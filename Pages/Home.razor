                        <h2>👋 About Me</h2>
                        Hello and welcome to my online profile!
                        I'm Diamond — a passionate <a href = "PersonalDetails"> Computer Scientist</a> and Applied Mathematician specializing in <a href="#projects">Software Development</a>, **Web Hosting**, and **Server Management**.
                        As a resilient problem solver, I thrive on writing high-performance, secure code. My interests span **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **AI**, and I enjoy building programs that think smart.
                        Though I’m a full-stack developer, my heart lies in backend engineering — the brains behind the screen. I bring clever configurations and server-side magic to life.
                        As a strong team leader, I know how to align team roles with individual strengths and weaknesses for maximum impact.
                        <br><br>    My love for solving and resolving complex daily life problems and tasks with computer programmes, drives me to create innovative solutions that make a difference. I believe in the power of technology to transform lives and am committed to continuous learning and growth in this ever-evolving field.
                        I would love to see myself one day building a software programme that helps humanity in enhancing their abilities and capabilities.  
                        <br><br>
                        Feel free to explore my <a href="/projects">Projects</a> and get a glimpse of what I’ve been building!
